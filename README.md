# Launching My First Windows EC2 Instance on AWS ðŸš€

This is my first hands-on project on AWS where I:

- Launched a Windows EC2 instance using the AWS Console
- Configured RDP access securely with a key pair
- Logged in using RDP and explored cloud computing basics
- Understood instance states, AMIs, and security groups

ðŸ“„ See the full PDF report [here](Windows-EC2-Instance-Launch.pdf)

## ðŸ”œ What's Next?
I'll be hosting a static website on this Windows instance soon!
